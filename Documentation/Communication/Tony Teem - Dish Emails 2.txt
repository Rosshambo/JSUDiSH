Which methods are supposed to be able to set the precision? Is it just DA? I
know mc won't need it, and of course real time. How about DL? and how high
can the precision go? Here's how I've coded it
1 = 10.1
2 = 10.12
3 = 10.123
4 = 10.1234
5 = 10.12345

I found a bug. You are pulling the wrong data for the realTime class.
Everything you need to pull is actually located in the RealTime method,
instead of using any of the inherited methods. So for all the real time
information you should be using:
rttemp.getMinReward()

etc.

If there is anything missing from the realTime.java class please let me know
and I can add it to pull from the inherited methods. As it stands now you
are putting strange stuff into the database for RealTime.. which is fine
because we will need it later, but I know for sure you are pulling the wrong
"indifference point" it needs to be pulled directly from the realtime method
like this..

rttemp.getTotalPoints()

and for the max points it would be

rttemp.getMaxPoints()

see what I mean?
