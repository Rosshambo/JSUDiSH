Subject:	Dr. Garrett Meeting Time

I spoke with Dr. Garrett today and we will be meeting with him on Mondays
and Wednesdays during our scheduled class time on days where we are not
having class. We are also waiting on word from "The Dempsey's" when we can
meet with them for all of the information we need about the project. As soon
as I know, you will know!
We will not meet today (1/14) but this was our milestone for the week. You
are welcome :-)

We will meet with Dr. Thornton on Monday at 11:30 and with Dr. Garrett on
Monday at 12:30. Unless you guys know something I do not we will be meeting
in each professor's office.

If you have time please post in the forums what times you CAN meet during
the week. If you can not make the meeting with "The Dempsey's" that is fine.
Those of us that can make it will try to fill you in as much as we can.

Jaleesa - I will be making .pdf files of the handouts Dr. Garrett gave us
and post them on blackboard as soon as I have time.

Thanks,
Tony

I'm a bit confused about our ethics journal. Is it supposed to only contain
articles that are relevant to computer science or can it be anything
relating to ethics? Mrs. Jensen seems like a cool professor but the more I
think about some of the things this class requires the more confused I get.
Maybe you caught something I missed.

Hey Y'all,

Tony, you were not in the hall when Tonya, Lori and I had this discussion about
who should do the prototype. Well I emailed Dr. Garrett, and he basically
agreed with what I suggested, which was that Tonya should do the prototype
(preferably in Visio) and hand it to you guys for the GUI design.

Tonya, perhaps you could do the prototype for each method one at a time, then
hand it in to Lori and Tony so that they will always have something to work
with, instead of waiting to do it all at once- or maybe not- just a suggestion.
I'm sure you guys will work something out.

Subject:	Re: prototype/interface question

Absolutely. For the interface design, Tonya should basically be
telling Tony and Lori what to do. Her prototype should specify how it
looks and how it behaves. All Tony and Lori should have to do is make
the interface to conform to the prototype. And I'd rather Tonya did it
in Visio. It's made for that sort of thing. She can get a copy from
the department, if she doesn't have one already.

By the way, Logan is going to be a great asset for the database stuff.
He caught on very fast. You guys aren't going to have to worry about
that part. He seems to be a strong team member.

When we meet as a group for the design, we should be able to get
everything hammered out so that people can split up and work
relatively independently. However, there will be some people with very
little to do during implementation (Tonya, Logan, and Andrew). I think
they would be best served to work on the test plan and maybe a brief
user's manual for the software. That would be a nice addition that the
Dempsey's would appreciate. Of course, that's just my opinion.

I am sorry this is coming out so late. I did not realize that we were
indecisive about who was doing what part at this point in the game. We need
to stop being so passive aggressive with each other and step up to the plate
to play the game. There is a lot riding on this project and we have to do it
right.
I have posted a rough draft (with missing information) onto Google Docs.
Please take a look and enter in any information you think is missing. If you
do not receive an invitation, please let me know.

I want to meet with the whole group on Monday at 12:30pm. It's time
for the first of what will probably be several lashings of the
semester. The analysis document is far from done. The clock is ticking
here. It needs quite a bit of work, and you and Tony need to put some
people on the different sections. There were more that we talked about
including, I think, and those should be in there. Check your notes.
And when you write this document, think of it this way... I plan to
show this, no matter its quality, to any potential employers who call
me for a reference for you. Your effort here will be rewarded later
and I will be able to give you a sterling recommendation. Lack of
effort here will have consequences beyond this semester. This goes for
the entire team, but I will reserve the majority of the praise or the
lashings for you two.

In any event, I intend to motivate you guys on Monday. Make sure that
everyone is there. No one misses this one. It will be short.

I've gone through the document. It looks significantly better. We're
in good shape to hit the deadline with room to spare now. Some stuff
at the end still needs work in terms of describing the new
functionality and stuff with the database. Make sure Logan and Andrew
finish their stuff, and make sure that the interface components are
described as completely as you can.

You guys should force every one of your team members to read through
the entire document. More eyes means fewer mistakes. I sprinkled
random insults towards Tony throughout the paper (no offense, Tony;
you're my punching bag on this one). So if you turn this thing in and
I find one of them, I'll know for certain that someone dropped the
ball. And don't try the Find function. I was more creative than that.
You'll have to read the whole document to find them.

Just to be clear, you guys are the managers, but that doesn't mean
that you have to do all of the work. Delegate, and follow up. If
something is done well, tell them so. If it's done poorly, tell them
so. But make them do their own work if you can.

By the way, this document is starting to look like something I'd be
happy be happy for the Dempsey's or an employer to see. Well done. But
make sure that you and the team race all the way to the tape. We'll
probably tweak all the way to the deadline, so be prepared. But the
major effort is over. OK. That's your praise for the month. Don't
spend it all in one place.

Hey Everyone,

Its about 11:15 on Friday Night, yeah I know loser right :). Anyways
when I got home from work at about 9, I started some revisions on the
analysis document. I have added them below the sections that were in
question, so that we could still see the original. Anyways I commented
before and after what I added so you can easily distinguish what I
wrote and beat me in the head with a hammer if you would like. Also if
you're a grammar Nazis please take a look at it because I am not.

Thanks,

Subject:	DiSH design

The design that we put together today is very good. I have a working
prototype now using that design, and it appears to be very localized.
Everyone takes care of their own stuff, so it should be really easy to
make changes and additions as needed. Implementation won't be that
bad, it looks like. But there's plenty more to be done. I'm going to
prototype the database insertion and then finalize the prototype XML
file format. Then I'm stepping away from this for you guys to take and
finish. Ignore the code that I gave you to begin with. I had to change
most of it to fit this new design, but we're better off because of it.
And I thought the first design was good. Man, I was way off. In any
event, I'll give you guys the code I have as soon as it's ready for
the D's to use.

It looks really good, Tony. I have 2 comments.

First, you can resize the drawing area if you want to get it all onto
one canvas. It's under File -> Page Setup. You might want to make 2
tabs -- one for the full connected and described system and the other
for just the class names and their connections (without all the
methods and stuff). The second one should easily fit onto a printable
page.

Second, don't forget that your system has more stuff than the one that
I gave you. Make sure that everything is accounted for. I'm not sure
what you have or don't have, but make sure to put everything that's
needed in the final product.

Due to being very sick, and possibly contagious, I won't be able to meet
today. Sorry this is so late.
We have made the connection graph and have started on the descriptions for
the class. We'll be done by Friday if you have time to look it over then.

I'm not really acquainted with what you are doing with the database. As long
as everything we know about is there it should be fine. If you would like
some feedback on it, maybe send it to Logan or Dr. Garrett?

Here's that write-up of the schema. Since I expect changes will be made

I think I covered for the most part what needed to be covered. Look over it,

hey i added some stuff to the api, at the bottom, would you mind looking at
it when you get a chance.
I have been playing with java and the db, I am able to connect to the db,
retrieve data from it, and insert data into the db, so I am pretty pumped I
got all that figured out. Anyways just let me know if there is anything else
you need from me. I'm willing to do whatever to the best of my ability just
let me know.

Thanks,

Oh, the fall schedule is up...So here's my schedule if you're wondering.





 CS 488 TR 12:45-2:15 Chao  MS 302 TR 2:30-4:00 Case  CS 333 TR 4:30-6:00 KP



 CS 450 MW 4:30-6:00 Francia

I'm pretty excited, no classes on Friday, woohoo!  That's never happened
before!  And no early mornings on Tues and Thurs.  I'll probably go into
work on Mon and Wed and tell them I have class at 3:00 or 1:45 or something
so I can have some in between time.

For those that still have questions Dr. Garrett will be meeting with us at
12:30 in his office. If you do have questions but can't make the meeting
please send him an email. I need a finished product emailed to me or jaleesa
by the end of today!

You'll be fine this really wasn't a database issue as much as me just being
confused about the classes. I think that is probably right, you will pass me
the whole class and all of it's subclasses and then I can use get methods to
populate the database with.

I was under the impression that you were going to accept it as it's own
class.. for example, we pass you the whole experiment class with all of it's
subclasses and information and you use whatever get methods we have created
to pull from the file and send to the database. I don't know how databases
work exactly so if this is incorrect I need to know! This may be a better
question for Dr. Garrett.
We need to meet tomorrow, with or without Garrett, all of us that can make
it. There are some details that we all need to agree upon. Not knowing
database really sucks right now, I can't wait to take it next semester.  And
if you take it with me I'll be your best friend since you are getting all of
this practice now =)

Is that the Personnel thing? aka the investigator? Look at the API file we
made under the experiment class... is that a missing class? I just realized

Hey thanks,
I am attaching a visio file of a class diagram for the database. I guess I
am dense but I'm kinda having a hard time thinking of this as in classes. I
think I keep trying to think of it as a database, so I'm going to explain
how I think it should work and then if you will please steer me straight.

Ok the DB class I provide you should have 2 methods in it, you and lori will
take the information and pass it to me as what? a string, or would you pass
everything to me via separate methods like setfirstname etc... I am just
wondering if I need to create a method to get and set every variable needed
in the database, or if I can just create an insertDB method and a retrieveDB
method. If the latter is how it's supposed to be would you be passing it as
a string and would it be structured the same everytime so I could just use a
delimiter or something to parse it and insert the data into a mysql query?

Thanks Logan

has to work so I'll have to take some great notes =) Do you want the whole
group? or just Lori and I? I hadn't really thought about the connection
between the XML loader and the creation of the experiment... what's the best
way to do that? i just had a vague idea of a new experiment class that loads
in all the necessary information. Like she would form each class then pass
in Lists or variables for the whole program.

OK. You need to use the Java standard naming scheme for methods and
variables (camel notation like addSomeVariable). I'm doubtful about
your calcIndifPoint (which I'd rather just spell out all the way,
really) being in the method classes. Here's the question that you have
to ask: Can the DoubleLimit class determine the indifference point
itself? The answer, if you think about it, has to be "no". Why?
Because to find the indifference point, you have to interact with the
participant. The DoubleLimit class doesn't do that. That's the job of
the DoubleLimitUI class. But the UI classes could easily give that
value to the method classes via the setters/getters. In that case,
though, it would just be a getIndifferencePoint method (rather than
calc, which is misleading).

I'm not too concerned about the design document being flawless,
actually, because it's going to be a good learning experience for you
guys when you have errors in it that you didn't anticipate. I'm mostly
concerned about the parts on the edges being right (where integration
is going to happen). Make sure that you spend as much effort and
thought as you can on those parts, because they're the critical ones
for us. Make sure you have clear in your mind the answers to these
questions:

How will Jaleesa give the Experiment object to you and Lori?
How will you give the Experiment object to Logan to add to the database?
How will Logan allow you to let an experimenter log in?
How will you allow Logan's data output system to integrate with your
experiment system?

Remember, you have to kind of write the code in broad strokes in your
head. If there's any part that seems foggy when you do that, then
you're not done with design.

The document looks pretty good, considering we didn't have very long
to do it. I'd like to see those UML pictures in the final version. And
I want everyone to understand that once the design document is in,
there will have to be a very compelling reason to change something
that it says. Making additions later is easier than deletions or
revisions.

A few other issues I see...
I'm not convinced that the Experiment class should be the main
controlling frame for the program. That seems like something that
should be its own class. A class (in general) should do one thing only
and should do it fully. If the Experiment class represents the
experiment and its data, then it shouldn't also have to take care of
log-ins and menus and stuff. That needs to be separated out.

I would be in favor of stating that OptionUI extends from
JRadioButton. That way, you could make some assumptions about things
you can do with it (like determine if it's selected, make it a part of
a button group, etc.). Just because it extends JRadioButton doesn't
mean it has to LOOK like a radio button. We can make it look like
whatever we want. It just means that it logically behaves like a radio
button.

The OO design stuff just takes time to learn. And other people with
this same problem might come up with a completely different, and
possibly better, design than what we are working on. I'm certain of
this, though. When you guys get to the end of this project and see all
the dots connected, you'll be able to see the holes in the initial
design and maybe see how they could have been avoided. There are still
parts of this project that I don't quite see to the end of, but I'm
certain that it can all be done within the framework we have outlined
here.

Why don't you guys come by the office tomorrow and show me what you
have by then?

Btw, I have a working prototype finished, and it is uber-sweet. Suck it,
losers!

Precondition: what MUST be true before the function can safely be called
Postcondition: what WILL be true after the function does its job

The pre/post-conditions represent a contract of sorts with the caller
of your function. You say "if you promise to do (precondition) then I
promise to give you (postcondition)".

A couple of questions.
A precondition is a description of something that MUST happen before this
method can be invoked right?

What is a postcondition?

No. If it's just a standard setter or getter, then there's no reason
to elaborate. If it does something more interesting (like constrain
the value that's being set), then you should put it in there.

To add parameters to those functions, you need to click the operation
and then click "properties..." and a new window will pop up that has
choices like "parameters" and "exceptions", which is where some
important stuff should go. The stuff you wrote looks right, but you
really want to put that into the document itself underneath your

Tony,

I'm not feeling this diagram- I still couldn't get the parameters to go
inside the parentheses, so I guess I'm just retarded. I've written things
about the methods if you click on the class and then on the "Methods" tab.
Don't hesitate to let me know about any questions you have.

OK. I didn't compile it, but I'm pretty sure I can spot the errors by
just looking at it.

First, it's not an error, but we need to adhere to the Java standard
of capitalizing class names. So "time" and "timeUnits" should be
"Time" and "TimeUnits".

Second, you have made the attributes static, which means there is only
one copy of that attribute for ALL instances, instead of one copy per
instance. So, I'm sure that your test main is showing that both
instances eventually have the value of 12, even though you only set
the second one to be 12. That's because there is only one "value"
variable that is shared among all instances you ever create. Setting
it for one sets it for all.

To fix it, just take out the static keyword on both of those
attributes. Generally, attributes should only be static if they are
also constant (so "final static").

That's ok, I'll just put something to the effect of gain more expertise with
XML as your milestone =) As long as I have something that is ok, I just want
some short term stuff so we can try to keep everyone on track. For Lori and
I it's just code, code, code, probably working on the base classes for this
milestone then getting the UI functioning for the 2nd milestone, that will
give us the last milestone to fill in any blanks and bug squashing.

Okay, made some revisions to my three goals. Also, I'm attaching a copy of

I spoke to Dr. Garrett today, and he said he'd like to have a group meeting
real soon, just so he can know where everything stands, see if there's any
problems, etc. He did not tell me anything as far as a date or time, though;
he said he'd probably send Jaleesa and Tony an email, so they will probably
know more fairly soon. Just thought it might be nice to give everyone a
little heads-up.

2. Race is an enumerated data type... like in Java when you do

So, for example, if you wanted to set the Race on a participant, you would

I just spoke with Dr. Garrett a few minutes ago. Most of what was said was
just for me and Logan to know. But he did ask me to pass along a message to
y'all: he would like to be updated whenever we have something to show, and
when we have something that works. So, whenever we make some progress, it
probably would not be a bad idea to shoot him off an email.

Right...or like we said in Ethics Wednesday, outsourcing is a dirty word to
us IT people.  It doesn't matter on getting together, if you want to we
can.  When do you work?  I get out of class at 9:45 and then I'll be done
for the day, until 6:30.  Brandy and me are going to the Sweeney Todd play
at JSU.

Tony,

I'm just writing to let you know that today Logan asked me to help him with
some programming stuff for the database. He said that Andrew really isn't
helping him, and he's feeling kind of stressed. I told Dr. Garrett what was
going on and just wanted to let you in on it. I talked to Andrew and he said
that he was going to add some fields into the schema and put up the
screenshots, since, of course, he's had tests in other classes and stuff.

My xml stuff is about done; I will work on the classes this weekend and then
get in touch with you on Monday or Tuesday to see what you need me to do, so
you could probably start thinking about what you want me to do now.

All we really have left to do is write a few easy algorithms, code up the
GUI's and then inject Dr. Thornton's thing into the project and.. we're
done?

Ok, did some more work, got it too look a little better. see if you can
figure out why the RealTime window is all scrunched up..
Also, look and see if you have a more updated Interface Design.vsd file... I

OK. I fixed the code and committed the changes. The problem was that
you should only have one timeUnits enumerated type. The Time class
expects a constructor that takes a float and a Time.timeUnits type.
You were passing it a float and a Method.timeUnits type. Just because
your Method.timeUnits enumeration happened to be identical to the
Time.timeUnits enumeration doesn't mean that they're interchangeable
to the compiler (because it isn't smart enough to understand that). So
you just need to prepend "Time" to the beginning of any use of your
timeUnits enumeration (outside of the Time class; inside, you can just
call it "timeUnits"). For instance

Time.timeUnits tu = Time.timeUnits.SECONDS;

Ok, i freaked out a little bit earlier today. Glad I emailed you instead of
calling you. What I decided to do is I made a dummy program that just shows
off each panel and how it will be laid out. All we need to do then is just
make it look the same, which I think it does since some of the code is taken
from Garrett's program. I'm good now, when I finish this I will send it to

We need to meet, I can't figure out any more of these errors and we have to
get them tackled. I'm hoping that together we can maybe make some

I have compiled Dr. Garrett's code and I don't get any of the miglayout
errors.  I don't get that.  Maybe the code is wrong, I don't know.  But the
stuff with the miglayout was copied from Dr. Garrett's code.  If you want to

I'm not sure what's going on then... Do we need to work on this together?
I'm not sure what you have added and what needs to be completed yet... and I
can look and see what is going on what the miglayout stuff.

Hey!  I have the exact same thing in my classpath and the QTJava.zip and
miglayout-3.7.jar files are in the ones they are supposed to be, but it's
still not working.  I have tried them about 100 different ways and nothing
works.  Arrrggg!  Maybe I'm not cut out for this degree.  I even have 2
jdk1.6.0 folders one is a 10 and the other is a 12.  I have tried both.  I'm
still getting 29 errors no matter which way I do them.  Is it supposed to go
in the Path or the Classpath variable?  I've tried them both and they don't
work.  I have even tried make a new User Variable and that doesn't work.
I'm about to give up for tonight.  I'll won't work on this again until

I've tested all of the miglayout code, so it's all correct. Did you ever get
it to add to your class path? if you put it in its own directory, then add
that to the class path variable like when you added the java stuff to
windows it should work then.

when you compile with ant it makes an executable .jar file inside the dist
folder.I think his is runnable, just make sure you have microsoft SQL
installed. (most computers already have it)
I made some changes to the main.java file. Added the jfilechooser and such,
so if you haven't made any changes to that file then just update it.

Hey!  I have made some major modifications to the documents.  There are
still 29 errors, which mostly deal with the miglayout.  For some reason, it
just does not like the miglayout.  I haven't looked at it too closely.  I've
been comparing our files to Dr. Garrett's and copying and pasting things we
need and modifying them to work with ours.  I changed the enumerated reward
type to a string, because it just seems to work a lot better.  Especially
with how many errors there were as I kept getting farther into it.  I'm

Are you sure that's the final?  What happened to the buttons on the Multiple
Choice and Real time?  I thought they were smaller.  Also, I thought the two
buttons on the last page weren't going to be there.

Hello all,

(Tony, Lori)
Just writing to let you know that I've posted a corrected xml file on
groups. I remember I told Lori she could use the old one, but I had to make
a quick change to it. Its done now.

(Logan, Tonya, Andrew)

Ok so the Dempsey's said we were missing some demographics...ones they put
in the feedback. I'll forward the email to you guys. I know Logan & Andrew
would have to make changes to the database design, and Tonya, you would have
to change the interface a little bit, but besides that, it's no biggie. Tony
and Lori, I'm not real sure if this will affect what yall are doing, but if
it is, I know yall will take care of it.

Be Breezy,

Hi Tony (and Jaleesa),

I just realized we are missing two demographic variables in the program 
you showed me.  These were ones that we provided in the our feedback on 
the DiSH analysis document.  First, we need to know their year in 
school.  It needs to be required that they answer this question.  Also, 
can you make it like you did with age so the default start of the list 
is 1st semester freshman in college?  Here's the question and menu choices:

What is your school classification?
4th grader
5th grader
6th grader
7th grader
8th grader
9th grader
10th grader
11th grader
12th grader
1st semester freshman in college
2nd semester freshman in college
3rd or 4th semester freshman in college
sophomore in college
junior in college
senior in college
5th-year senior or beyond in college
masters-level graduate student
doctoral-level graduate student
not currently enrolled in school

Also, there should be a textbox (around 20 characters wide) that is 
labeled "Participating Course" where they can enter information about 
the course they are receiving credit for.  This should NOT be a required 
field.

Best,
Dr. Dempsey

Yeah, this is going to be tricky with the JToggleButtons.  He puts them in
the buttongroup in the scenarioUI...and then adds them to the panel.
Whereas, you add them into the panel in their individual method.
Hmmmm....that's gonna require some thinking.  I'm going to eat now.  I've

K!  I changed the OptionUI to a JToggleButton instead of JRadioButton.  Is
there a way to open certain class files so we can see what they look like
without having to copy the code to another folder and then comment out the
package stuff?  That's what I've been doing, and then just making the
changes in the copied code and when I get done saving as and then

Hey!  I tried putting the Main in a JScrollPane and this is what it gave
me.  I even tried setting the size as you can see by that code commented
out.  Take a look at it both ways.  It might be better just to leave it in
the MultipleChoiceUI.  I don't know, let me know what you think.

Yes, real time, I have already got some realtime stuff going on. Like if you
select age then it shows a textbox where you can input the age, but if you
select race then a drop down menu shows with the possible races. I guess I
am just curious as to how each control will be named?
Thanks

Tony,
It's going pretty good, a couple of questions.

1.) If administrator A, is logged in and saves some queries, then you have
Administrator B, login and create some queries. Ok so now we have to admins
that have access to the admin panel and can view the queries created. Can
they view each other's created queries? If not and they are only able to
view their own, I need a way to get their username so I know who the user
is. This may be something we don't want to worry about this late in the
game, and just let all Administrators view all of the queries created. I am
going to program it like that for now. If you have any questions or comments
let me know, we can discuss it tomorrow if need be.

2.) I sent Dr. Garrett an email about this but I haven't heard back from him
yet. I probably will hear back from him later, but maybe you have ran across
this before. If I need to programmatically  create many instances of a
JComboBox, or a text field or any other form component. How would you do it,
I'm trying to figure it out for the query builder form, when the user hits
the checkbox it should continue to add Combo Boxes, I will figure something
out but thought maybe you could give me some direction.

Thanks,
Logan

I think having the entire thing in a scrollpane is probably the best way.
That way, it doesn't matter what size screen they use, etc, everything will
be accessible.

Either way, that was my question.  I have it set up both ways.  So, really
it's just deleting code and maybe add a bit more.

My thought was that we would only add the MC to a scrollpane whenever it is
created.. is the code built so that we can do that? If you want to leave it
in the scrollPane i guess all you need to do is remove what's in the
scrollpane and scrollPane.validate(); right?

username and password.  Should we keep it in the MC or put it in the Main.

I asked Dr. Garrett about this and this needs to happen with the first
release. This means that Logan will have to add these to the database.
Jaleesa will not be affected by it. Lori and I are already making plans to
implement it. Andrew will have to add it to the database docs.
Thanks,
Tony!

Hi Tony (and Jaleesa),

I just realized we are missing two demographic variables in the program you
showed me.  These were ones that we provided in the our feedback on the DiSH
analysis document.  First, we need to know their year in school.  It needs
to be required that they answer this question.  Also, can you make it like
you did with age so the default start of the list is 1st semester freshman
in college?  Here's the question and menu choices:

What is your school classification?
4th grader
5th grader
6th grader
7th grader
8th grader
9th grader
10th grader
11th grader
12th grader
1st semester freshman in college
2nd semester freshman in college
3rd or 4th semester freshman in college
sophomore in college
junior in college
senior in college
5th-year senior or beyond in college
masters-level graduate student
doctoral-level graduate student
not currently enrolled in school

Also, there should be a textbox (around 20 characters wide) that is labeled
"Participating Course" where they can enter information about the course
they are receiving credit for.  This should NOT be a required field.

Best,
Dr. Dempsey

The compile errors that are happening is because we are missing a file....
we are missing the InvalidXMLException.java file it seems. Did you create
one? all I can find on the Internet is that it's not included in the Java
API but is created by the user and extends java.lang.exception.. Anyone know

Just a heads up for those who were not at the meeting with Dr. Garrett & a
reminder for those who were in attendance-When you have edited a file that
must be uploaded to the svn repository, leave comments clearly describing
what changes were made to the file. This way, we can know who changed what
when.

I think I have a solution...
try{ Thread.sleep(2000); }
catch(InterruptedException e){ System.out.println("sleep didn't work"); }

this code will freeze a program for x number of milliseconds, might help
with your blank panel problem.

Are you running the program from command line with:

java - jar dish.jar    ?

If not, try it that way and see if you get the same errors.

Yeah!  I added the blank panel in, but it has some problems.  I commented
the XML stuff out and uncommented the hard coded Experiment.  Also, the
logout button is in the frame, it was in the wrong place, I just had to move
it down two lines.  On OS, I started the Case Two sorting.  Case One we just
have the execution.  Are we going to use a timer, or how are we going to do

if you are going to compile using ant, all you have to do is type "ant" into
the command line in the root directory of the project.then you type "cd
dist"
then "java -jar dish.jar"

if that is your question, hope I understood it correctly.

oh wow, you are using netbeans? I haven't the slightest clue where MigLayout
needs to be... We've just been using notepad++ to edit all our code and
using a command line compiler.. I really havent' the slightest clue where
add-in jar files need to be placed for a good compile.
Btw, using ant will compile the code and place all the files you need to run
the code in the dist directory. You might want to try adding the miglayout
file to your PATH, and it doesn't matter what it is named, so if you wanna
rename it to MigLayout and place it in a temp directory that would be fine.

One bug i've noticed so far with your DBUI. When you click edit user it
doesn't set the privilege drop down box to the privilege the person actually
has. You know the code better than I, can you fix this easily?
Thanks,
Tony

btw, i did edit a bit of your code, trying to remove the border, but
removing a border from a tabbed pane is a huge hassle. but I also made some
changes I left, can't remember what so make sure you update your code before
you edit it.

Ok, so I got it fixed, which by the looks of what time it is now I'm going
to fail my test tomorrow since I haven't even started studying.  There are 3
usernames: loganmoore(pw: bob), bobbyj(pw: jones), and dish(pw: dish).  You
can test them all now.  I had to change some of his code.  He only had it
checking the username, so I had to add the password in there.  Also, if the
username has stuff in it, but not the password it will pop up an error
message for the password, and vice versa.  If both are empty it pops up an
error message saying both are invalid.  Test it every which way you can.  I
think I have that part bug proof now.  I hope so at least.  I tested it
every which way.  The only thing is I edited the bobbyj username and when I
ran it again it passed the wrong privilege number back, so that would be the
only thing that would go wrong.  I have no idea why it did that, I went and
edited it again and it fixed it.  Go figure!

I'm about to start cussing.  Everytime freaking time I go in there, the
usernames and passwords are changed.  Logan's didnt' even work.  None of
them did, not the ones that were in there at least.  I'm so freaking mad at
SVN, too!  Last night I accidentally added the HOS project stuff to my
desktop and accidentally forgot to put it in a folder and now it has the
question marks on all my shortcut programs on my desktop and I don't know
how to remove them.  I uninstalled it last night and just now reinstalled it
and then checkedout the code for both and it's doing the same thing...but I
put them in folders this time, y?

no, just put this in your root directory of the project and it should build
all by itself! you can find the executable jar file in the dist folder

Yeah that worked, thanks!  I sent Logan my Flashcard program so he could
study for OS.

I just wanted to jar it up.  Now I know how to make a jar file, so cool!  So
much better than having to go to the command prompt every time and running
it.  Thanks!

just put it in some directory, then name the package that directory.
compile everything in that directory

Make a MainClass.txt document. In it put Main-Class: [directory name].[main
class name] (note:  no .java and make sure the file has 2 lines, the 2nd one
should be blank)

then:  jar cmfv MainClass.txt YOURJARNAME.jar "the name of the directory you
just made"

and to execute:  java -jar YOURJARNAME.jar

call me if you have questions, i'm about to head out for some grub.

The problem is that you're using my SaxExperimentHandler instead of the (I
assume) ExperimentLoader. My class isn't equipped to handle your XML file
components, and it gets confused and tries to read a string as an integer.

Jaleesa's class doesn't yet do what it needs to do, because I tried using it
instead but it has problems that need to be fixed very soon. If you're going
to use my class, you need to use it to open the old XML file (before all of
the changes/additions were made).

Would you mind taking a look at the code? All the pieces are there now, but
we are getting errors that I can not understand. It's when you load the
experiment.xml file. Use dish/dish as login and password. The errors
indicate that it is the XML loader, but it doesn't name a line and none of
the errors make any sense to me.

hey just keeping my word and telling you i'm done with experimentLoader
(still not sure about soonerTime), it compiled successfully, however i
couldn't build it because of errors with miglayout, which may have something
to do with the apache ant not working correctly. I'm about to uninstall ant.

Tony,
In the characters method in the ExperimentLoader classI'm not real sure
about how to handle the soonerTime- I ran into this same problem with
laterTime, until I saw that it's used under the MAXTIME conditional. I know
if I add soonerTime, then I'll probably have to add its setters and getters
in the Method class, where the laterTime setters n getters are defined. Any
suggestions?

Thanks,

Jaleesa

ps
I'm sorry if this is a dumb question & I just don't realize it yet, but i'm
running on 3 hours sleep (babysitting 3 month old last night).

Ok, trying to set up the database on my laptop. What was it I needed to
change other than the name and p/w in the config.inc.php file? It keeps
giving me an error =(

I think you should help Logan out however you can. Motivating Andrew is no
longer worth our effort, and he will get all of the credit that he deserves.
His name is on the project, certainly, but it will not be on the product.
Please have Logan (and you or Tonya, if it applies) document the attempts at
communication with him and his missed deadlines as best you can. Include
Andrew in all team communications, but don't make any expectations. Work as
if he will not contribute.

You guys are doing a good job in spite of this situation, so don't spend any
time on it.

So, I attempted to add the StudyPalWidget, but I got have 47
errors...hmmmm!  I'm not going to upload that though, b/c i know Logan is
working on it now.  Oh, and I did put the package stuff in the java files.
I also tried adding his compile, run, and jar file into the dist folder but
that didn't take any errors away.  Well, I'm going to take my grandparents
out to eat, so maybe i will have time later tonight to look at all this some
more.

Really?!  Well, I will save my congratulations until I see it in action, but
I am cautiously optimistic that you guys will one day receive a small amount

high, though. :-)

Well done, guys. I can't wait to see the beta.

Well, I'm stumped....for some reason it just does not want to remove the
database when you click log out.  But it puts the log in screen over the
database, but when you hit submit it crashes.  I'm starting to hate all
these different panels and all.  I also can't get the blank panel thing to
work.  Dr. Thornton said something about repainting or painting or
something, so I might look into that.

So, I'm still having no luck with the blank panel thing.  We need to have a
panel for the instructions too!  We haven't done that yet, also what about
Dr. Thornton's code?  Should we go ahead and add that in?  We won't actually

Dr. Garrett,

I'm writing this email regarding Andrew.  As I'm sure that you are aware of,
he has contributed very little so far, and I was hoping that perhaps you
could talk to him and try to "light a fire" underneath him.  I know that if
we really haven't needed him this far, we probably won't need him now,
however *I want to give a final chance to really contribute*.  I have told
him before that the team needs him to contribute more to this project, but
alas, nothing much has changed.

Logan continually tells me that he contributes very little, and Logan is
feeling pretty overwhelmed so far.  Logan has also informed me that
communication with Andrew is slow; it's hard to come into contact with him.
Since my part is mostly done, I will begin to help Logan with the database,
doing what I can.

If you don't think it will help talking at this point, that's fine.  I'm
just at the end of my rope, and just about wish I could take his name off
the whole project.

Thanks,

Jaleesa

DISH WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT LOADS EXPERIMENTS

Why it didn't work before:

In order to use a JPanel you have to instantiate it... we never instantiated
the mainContentPanel so it couldn't add it to the frame!

also, about your strange button issue, what if you did
getTopLevelAncestor().validate()

that should validate the entire frame.

YAY!

Hey!  Just wanted to let you know that you can ignore the previous emails
about problems with the blankpanel in between the scenarios or the
intertrial interval, i got that working.  I almost have the instruction
panels working.  Quick question dealing with that though.  The xml file is
supposed to have the instructions right, so I just need to pull them from
that, correct?  Jaleesa had for daInstructions in the xml file "Choose one
option".  That's not instructions...I don't understand why she wrote it that
way.  Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.  Anyways, take a look at it if you
wanna.  Ignore the instruction panels when you get to the multiple choice
and all, for some reason it's not pulling the right card or something.  I'll
have to work on it some more.  But, i've got to take a break right now.  I'm
tired of looking at all of this.

Hope you had fun at your competition!

That's what he wantswhy I spent so much time on it.
We also have to add a counter to give him a total for "wasted space", ie,
everytime a job is added to a memory segment, we have to subtract the size
of the segment from the size of the job and add that to a running total.

It looks good so far, other than the format of the results file.  But, I
don't have time to sit down and analyze it right now to make sure it's all
correct.

Hey!  I just updated it and ran it, it looks good, but I didn't realize
there was a text file, so I'll have to look at it when I get to
Jacksonville.  I'll be leaving here in 15-30 minutes.  I have to run by
Dillards in Oxford for my mom first.  So, are we finished up through Case
Two?  Or do we still need to work on Case Two?  I know we need to do Case
Three.  You think we'll get it finished now?  I'm getting kind of excited.

Always figure it out after I send the email. I got most of the errors fixed
by adding the cgjsapi.jar and the .dll to the lib and adding all of that to
the build.xml, but I am still getting 2 errors saying that it cannot find
TestAudioListener and TestEngineListener. They are both in the src code

Ok, so we are using Apache Ant to handle our compiles and all of that stuff.
Where are we supposed to put the .class files from your code? I tried
putting it in our src/edu/jsu/dish folder but I'm getting a ton of errors.
I'm kinda weak with Ant so i'm not sure what I need to do to get all this
put in. The errors we are getting are all "cannot find symbol" errors. Do we
need to put it somewhere else, or does the code need to have package data

I just added his code in, that was all.  I tried to add his jar file also.
I don't know if I added all the right stuff or not though...but a lot of his
imports were causing errors.  It couldn't find what it wanted to import.

Yeah, I mean all the cardlayout stuff is there, we just have to add his
stuff and set up the RealTimeUI for it, which I'm thinking just adds his
StudyPal to it and the extra buttons and all that we need.  And then of
course we need to add the functionality for it.

Wednesday is our next meeting, when it's due... Right?
No, I'm going to work on that after lunch. There were just a few small
things I wanted to tackle in DiSH that were annoying me.

I've almost got the execution of jobs finished in the HOS, just need a
little more work and that should be done.

You didn't solve any of my problems, if that's what you were trying to do.
If you go through the whole test, you'll see what my problem is.  Have you
worked any on OS?  Oh and when are we supposed to have the beta version for
dish done?

Ok, wow, that took longer than it should have. What I had to do to get the
instructions centered was change the instructions from a textArea to a
JTextPane. Then I had to create a rule for it to center and add that rule to
each pane.. it should work now tho!

ExperimentUI Lines 48-130.  It's in the cardlayout. But I have a different
panel that adds the instructions by "center, wrap, grow" and then adds a
continue button.  I had to use a different panel for each different method.
Maybe you know of a better idea.  That's the only way I could get it to
work.

Where does the program add the instructions? What file and line? wherever it
is you need to add "center" to the end of the line that adds that
instructions...

Check out NumberFormat under java.text in the API, I think that is our
answer to the long decimals problem. However, I'm not 100% sure I know where
it needs to go... Probably in each Options class?

Hah!  I got Best Fit to work, but I've got to fix a lil problem in my
sorting according to Shortest Job First.  So, I should be able to copy the
Best Fit code into Case 2 and it should be ready to go.  I'll get that after
Ethics tonight!  Maybe it won't take that long.  I might need your help on
figuring out the other thing.  What's happening is when there are two Jobs
the same size, it pulls the same one twice, it was pulling each job twice,
but i put a count in and now it does the same one twice, so how do i get it
to skip the first one after it's already been selected and go to the next
one.  If I can get that figured out, I'll be done with that.

Can we make the DBUI smaller?  If you add the background to the jsu image
you can tell how far the database goes down.  On line 77, uncomment the line
and then go to the database and you'll see what i mean.

The only way I can see to make it move up is to remove "fill" from the
frame's MigLayout, which we don't want because then everything is squished
up at the top.

the reason it is down there is because the DBUI window is so big. It's

Tony,

i think those two class files are not packaged (ie, i always did a:
javac -cp .;cgjsapi.jar Blah.java

the "classpath" with the "." was what included those files.  i took
them from cloudgarden, but i would be content to recompile them with
your package structure, if you'll tell me how it goes.

Well, I am a little stuck right now.  So, I'm going to go to bed...I can't
think straight.  I don't even know what I'm doing.  I'll work on it tomorrow
more.  Hopefully, I'll get it.  So far, I have the Case 3 sorted according
to Shortest Job (only by the size number), so I'm trying to compare and set
up a vector of jobs that have the shortest jobs first, but i'm stuck with
the comparing, b/c it adds some more than once if a number is duplicated,
instead of going to the next ones with the same size number.  Once I get
that done, it will just be figuring out how to get the Best Fit to work and
then I'll be done.  It would be awesome if I could get that done tomorrow,
but who knows.  When are we going to work on our Ethics presentation?  Ugh,
so much to do, so little time.  I'm going to go and buy me some energy
drinks tomorrow, maybe that will help this week!

uhh, just iterate through them all comparing the size to each job. keep
track of which index has the smallest size difference, then add it to that

trying to add another.

K!  Well, I'm still working on the HOS sorting..for some reason it keeps
giving a Null Pointer Exception with yours, or it prints out that wherever
you have it in the code.  Any reason why it keeps doing that?  It's done it
the past 10-20 times I've ran it.

April 8 is what it says in the design and analysis doc
and yeah, I think we will make it. Once I get the rt code to compile it's
just a matter of creating the thing, adding it to the panel.. nothing really
difficult to do. and handling the events.

hey guys,
I added the question tag and all methods have instructions. If something
still isn't right, let me know.

 Lori, if you look at the experiment.xml file, the last sentence in the
first set of comments says that the default time is seconds, so that's where
I got that from (earlier today) lol.

hey Tony,

I'm not sure if I told you the last time we met, the StudyPal program
is still missing one part: it has the readingPaused event, but it's
not presently working.  I will fix that today and send you the
complete version.

Dr. Garrett tells me you guys are doing very well.  Congratulations

I'm attaching it. You'll need to import the various classes as you need
them. They're all in the edu.jsu.tg (for "talking games") package. I'm also
attaching the source code for the example application that is included as
the point of entry for the JAR file (if you double-click it, as opposed to
compiling against it). You should be able to look at that code to see how to
use the classes.

Let me know if you have any trouble.

As far as I know I have all of the methods implemented, but I'm getting an
error saying that readingPaused wasn't overwritten. Also it's telling me
that I can't addStudyPalListener() to this.. ex:
myPal.addStudyListener(this); It doesn't like that at all, but all this
thing does is extend MethodUI which extends JPanal.. any ideas?

Hey tony,
Take a look at the experimentLoader file. I think I changed it as u wanted
it- it built and compiled successfully, but then it still wouldnt' allow me

No, as far as I know it is not right. The objective for the "tick marks" is
so they can set them themselves. so you need a function to set each
individual tick mark to an int. for example.
Tick1 = 1
Tick2 = 8
etc

whatever they want to show on the slide ruler is what they need to specify
for each tick.
so what I suggest is you read them all in, convert them to integers, then
push each integer into an array of size 10. then pass that 10 piece array
into the realtime.java file.

It might even be better as a string. because the method takes a string. so
if it would be easier to just leave them as a string, that's fine too.

Man. Ask me about hash tables in person and I'll explain it. It would take
too long to type it out. As for "is it right?", if the slider says it will
take a Hashtable for the labels, then what you're doing with the table is
reasonable.

Hey, I don't know if this matters, but is the SaxExperimentHandler

 It's like it's overriding itself...that's probably our problem.  I guess we

Hey, at the end of the ExperimentLoader.java file, it loads the
SaxExperimentHandler... is this intentional? doesn't the
SaxExperimentHandler do the same thing as ExperimentLoader? Just trying to
help you guys track down problems...

Let me know if this helps.

well, you just said the ExperimentLoader.java executes the
SaxExperimentLoader...which I just looked and it doesn't, so I don't know
what you meant by that.  Since it doesn't execute it then yes we need to
delete it...I'll fix it if I can.

That was my question. The SaxExperimentLoader seems to do the exact same

ok so i've put in a couple of diagnostic statements in the ExperimentLoader
file, and it seems to start parsing in the realTime method beginning with
the "maxTime" tag, instead of at the beginning of the xml document..Im
hoping that if this problem is solved, the xml will load correctly.  Any
suggestion are greatly appreciated lol.

As far as the XML is concerned, I just don't know anything about what you

Where does the code tell the xml parser to read the next line?

Why not just make the validation a seperate method that returns a boolean?
then if it validates we just start another method which parses the xml file?
is that what you were thinking?

The I/O problem is on line 57 of the ExperimentLoader.java file.
validator.validate(source); is giving an IOException.... then there are
other problems, but I wanna fix this first to see how the system reacts.

The first way. The second way is also fine, but setting it to null is a
waste of time since you're instantiating it right afterward.

This question is important to the DiSH project. We have some null happy
people in this group.

What is the best way to reset a variable? i.e. you want to instatiate the
variable over and over..
should you do something like this?

option = new Option();
option.setTime(30);
something.add(option);
option = new Option();

will that create a brand new option with the default "time"?

or should you do it with a null like this:

option = new Option();
option.setTime(30);
something.add(option);
option = null;
option = new Option();

Thanks,

YAY! I made it work! Kinda... we're getting new errors, but I fixed a bunch
of the old ones. Whenever you make a new class, you have to instatiate it
like this...
Method method = new Method();

if you set it to null that makes it a nothing, no class, no anything.

Now, on to more bug squashing!

Subject:	Re: First problem fixed.

Ok, here is what is going on. Some things are still being set to null
because they are not being set up right.
Here is what needs to happen.

In startElement -- Every time there is a class that is started (ie Time) we
need to re-instatiate that class (ie Time time = new Time())
In characters -- We need to ensure that everything is being passed into the
proper class like it should be.
in endElement -- things need to be added properly to each thing to form the
perfect experiment.

The problem is that we are getting nulls for something things so that when
we parse the exeperiment to build the UI, it throws null pointer exceptions.
It should never do that if the schema validates the xml file.

Subject:	Re: DISH Database Datatypes

It needs to stay as I've listed it. If you can open up the Visio document,
you should see some notes about each of those datatypes. You'll have to do a
mapping from what Tony and Lori give you to the type that you put into the
database, though. For instance, Tony and Lori may give you later_time_units
as a thing of type Time, where Time can have the values of SECONDS, MINUTES,
etc. You'll notice that the Visio document says something like SECONDS=1,
MINUTES=2, etc. So you'll add a 1 to the database as opposed to the string
"SECONDS". (There is absolutely no reason to add a string in this case. When
you're further along, you'll look back and see why.)

So look in the Visio document to find the mappings for those things. I think
that the response_delay was noted to just be stored as seconds no matter
what. So if they give it to you in minutes or hours, just do the conversion
to seconds first, and then add that to the database.

Make sense?

ok, the problem is the speech program freezes the regular program until you
say somethingonce you say a word (or any noise really, even a cough), it
unfreezes the program
so you really can't even test the RealTimeUI without some sort of input

Yeah, your stop reading button still does not work...it doesn't do anything.
 I hit it like 40 times and then after a good lag time it went to the end

Yes, when I run the .jar file by itself it doesn't show the text, but
running it in the program it works just fine... for whatever reason.

Tony,

as promised, here is version 1.3 of StudyPal.  It now fires a
readingResumed event when the reader begins reading again after a
readingPaused event.  also, StudyPal stops running once the end of the
document is reached (after the documentCompleted event is fired).  i
have tested that it stops running, but not exhaustively, so please
double check that.

as earlier stated, i have not put anything into packages, so please
run the app as shown in the SomeApp.java example (you can also refer
to the compile.bat and run.bat files).

you probably know this, but this is a .zip file.  i had to rename it
to fool gmail.

let me know how it goes.

hey Tony,

I will do that right now.  I ran the jar file that Garrett sent you
and me, and it gave me a strange error.  The file's text was not
showing up on-screen.  Did you have this problem?

I will send you a new jar file in the next few minutes, but I'm NOT
packaging it in the edu.jsu.tg folders, because not doing this kept me
from having that error.

One other thing. Is there a method to "turn off" or completely stop
StudyPal? For example, what if it is a 10 question test and they put real
time as the 2nd question. As it stands right now the StudyPal will keep
listening through the rest of the test. I hate to spring these things on

So, i don't sleep... ever.
I think we need one more StudyPalListener event. reading resumed. Whenever
the reader pauses, the button text reads "Resume Reading", and now I need an
event to return that button (which hindsight just needs to be a field, not a
button, what's the point of pushing it when it auto pauses in just a few

the only thing is he's getting errors for every line, b/c a) we don't have a
getRealTime() or getDoubleLimit() b) getMethod requires an int passed into
it and c) he's not pulling all of this from every method.  i've tried
explaining that to him, but i don't think he quite gets it.  i'm afraid i

Just a heads up. If someone has XP and Office 2007, they do not get any
speech support and they have to download the microsoft speech SDK 5.1 from
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5e86ec97-40a7-453f-b0ee-6583171b4530&displaylang=en#filelist

So, Logan is working on getting all the information from the
Experiment....he's trying to find the sooner time units and the sooner time.
 I thought it was supposed to be in the method.java class but I cannot find
it anywhere.  Any clue where it is?

yes, tony, this is easy to fix.  if you go to your windows control
panel, you almost certainly have a "speech" icon.  click on it, create
a new profile, name it, and go through the basic set up.  you don't
have to go through a long training bit unless you want to.  after the
profile is created, run the program and choose that profile.

let me know if you have other questions.

The error that reports when the StudyPal is executed is:
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at edu.jsu.tg.StudyPal.setupSpeech(StudyPal.java:154)

You can check it out for yourself, revision 238.

In the characters method, why is the Time commented out?
else if(currentElement.equalsIgnoreCase("MAXTIME")) {
float v = Float.parseFloat(value);
//Time t = convertToTime(v, timeUnits);
method.setLaterTime(v);
method.setLaterTimeUnits(Time.timeUnits.SECONDS);
}

Also in the characters method, should I cast the value variable as a
DistiributionType since thats only what the multipleChoice method will take
for this function?

else if(currentElement.equalsIgnoreCase("DISTRIBUTION")) {
//((MultipleChoice)method).setPointDistributionType(value);

upon taking an initial look at the startElement, characters, and endElement
methods, they seem to do what they should;
the startElement has new instantiations where ever they need to be;

the characters method- everything seems to be passed properly; no strings
are being passed to functions that only take floats UNLESS the string is
casted as a float.

endElement seems to add what it should add.

I'm continuously looking at this though.

So that's the reason for the null stuff. The code went from generic to
specific. Which is probably fine, but it sure is making it hard to wade

Ok, here's one for ya. Each scenario type takes 2 or more Options (the
class). In the case of something like DA, we should be pulling the first
scenario from the decreasingadjustment.java, then we should be creating new
scenarios until it works itself out and passing each finished scenario with
which was chosen back into the decreasingadjustment class.
Does this make sense?

I think I found a bug [?] If you run an experiment, then, without restarting
the program, start a 2nd experiment, the StudyPal no longer hears the mic.

Ok, I have a question concerning the realtime method. The person making the
test will need to be able to specify the maximum time to read for full
points right? Like, if they read for 30 minutes, they get the full amount of
points. We need to add this in to the XML and realtime.java files. the
variable shall be named maxTime with setMaxTime() and getMaxTime() methods

Hmm, that sucks.  Fortunately, that's not your problem, it's mine.  Pretend
that there will be no more than 1 realtime question per test for now.  I
will seek a solution for this next week, and check with Garrett about
whether this is an issue.

yeah, i know...that's why it doesn't make any sense to me.  it goes to the
end experiment method from the next() and this is what it does...
     cardLayout.last(this);
Database = new database();
java.sql.Timestamp end = new java.sql.Timestamp((new
java.util.Date()).getTime());
experiment.getParticipantInformation().setStartTime(now);
experiment.getParticipantInformation().setEndTime(end);
System.out.println("---------------begin time set: " +
experiment.getParticipantInformation().getStartTime() + "-------------");
System.out.println("---------------end time set: " +
experiment.getParticipantInformation().getEndTime() + "-------------");
System.out.println("End time: " + end);
Database.insertIntoDB(experiment);


i tried adding this line ((Main)this.getParent()).validate(); after the
cardLayout.last(this); and it works, but it throws an error saying
java.lang.ClassCastException: javax.swing.JPanel cannot be cast to
edu.jsu.dish.Main  and doesn't pass the experiment to the database.

Well, inside the real time all i have it doing when either the entire
document is read, or the button is pushed is pushing data back in the
RealTime.java object. Then it executes this command:
((ExperimentUI)this.getParent()).next();

so it might be inside that method?

I fixed it and uploaded it....I don't understand why it takes so long to go
to the end page when i get done reading the realtime stuff...in the
endExperiment method it first sets the cardlayout to the last card, then
creates a new instance of the database and passes the experiment and the
timestamps...i'm ready for this project to me over.

experimentUI lines 86-102......why in the heck does the real time not move
on to the rest of the experiment when you complete it?  i found a mic here
at the house, and the command prompt said document completed! they have read
83 words.  hooray we're done!....so why does it not move onto the double
limit and decreasing adjustment...also if i click on the stop reading it
passes the experiment to the database and starts inserting into it....

Ok, a quick search shows that you might need to check the version of the
Java Runtime Environment. Check java.com and make sure you have the latest
version. If you do, make sure you have the latest version of the java JDK.
You can check it by going into c:\program files\java and look at the
directory that starts JDK. those numbers are the version, you should have
1.6.0_13 or something close to that.

ok so added the maxReadingTime elements to the xml and to the
experimentLoader classes; i saw that the setMaxTime andgetMaxTime were
already in the rt class;
im heading to my sisters to babysit at about six oclock, and will be there
all night, and her internet provider is being retarded and wont connect...so
if you guys have any questions for me, you'll have to call me on my cell.
Sorry, I know this sux, but so does AT&T dsl for being retarded.

i'll add it tonight when i get back to jville...we're about to have a fish
fry.  but Logan is asking me how we calculate the response delay, it's set
with the xml, which doesn't make much sense to me since the api has it as
like 2 or 3 different things, so what is it actually supposed to do?

laptop with it already installed so that we don't have to waste time on
that. I'd like to celebrate your victory.

Oh. Well I don't want to break it to you, but that day never comes. And we
won't wait on it, either. However, we will reach a point at which you and I
are both satisfied that we have reached a release candidate. And that's when
we can put this project behind us, perhaps to be picked up later if you want
to carry it to version 2.0.

Hmm, in the XML I see you have a minReward and maxReward under RealTime.
Let's force them to assume that the minimum will always be 0, and just leave
the maxReward and set it using setTotalPoints() this can take a float. That
should be very easy right?

I think I may have found something else...
As long as the mic is picking up noise the pause timer keeps resetting.

or whatever generates the line:

///////////////////// i'm in the task, and it's been 1 seconds

so just doing "lalalala" may not progress the document, but the timer keeps
resetting so there is no pause event thrown.

that works, i didn't think of that...haha!  I think Logan is coming along,
he needs the sooner time and sooner time units...but isn't the sooner time

ahh, i see now, it will never pass stuff to the database the way you want it

the database, there isn't anything anywhere that says it should happen when
the button on the exitPanel is pressed.

Attachments:	340.png

Is it ok if I make one more request? Is there a way to put in one more event
that shows when the reading first starts? I have to implement 2 timers to
keep track of progress and an actual displayed timer. Currently the only way
I can see to implement them is to start them when the panel is displayed,
but they both run while the user is choosing their profile. I'm thinking
just fire the event when the first word is read? Something like that be easy
to add?
Thanks,
Tony
