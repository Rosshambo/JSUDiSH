I am sorry this is coming out so late. I did not realize that we were indecisive about who was doing what part at this point in the game.

Hey thanks,

I am attaching a visio file of a class diagram for the database. I guess I am dense but I'm kinda having a hard time thinking of this as in classes. I think I keep trying to think of it as a database, so I'm going to explain how I think it should work and then if you will please steer me straight.

Ok the DB class I provide you should have 2 methods in it, you and lori will take the information and pass it to me as what? a string, or would you pass everything to me via separate methods like setfirstname etc... I am just wondering if I need to create a method to get and set every variable needed in the database, or if I can just create an insertDB method and a retrieveDB method. If the latter is how it's supposed to be would you be passing it as a string and would it be structured the same everytime so I could just use a delimiter or something to parse it and insert the data into a mysql query?

Thanks Logan

I was under the impression that you were going to accept it as it's own class.. for example, we pass you the whole experiment class with all of it's subclasses and information and you use whatever get methods we have created to pull from the file and send to the database. I don't know how databases work exactly so if this is incorrect I need to know! This may be a better question for Dr. Garrett.

We need to meet tomorrow, with or without Garrett, all of us that can make it. There are some details that we all need to agree upon. Not knowing database really sucks right now, I can't wait to take it next semester.  And if you take it with me I'll be your best friend since you are getting all of this practice now =)

You'll be fine this really wasn't a database issue as much as me just being confused about the classes. I think that is probably right, you will pass me the whole class and all of it's subclasses and then I can use get methods to populate the database with.

I am attaching the database query form prototypes. I am about to go to bed for tonight, but I plan on working on this some more tomorrow. I am off so I will actually have some time to work on it. If you have any questions though feel free to text me at 2563905267, i will be up for another 30 minutes or so. If I don't get it tonight I will get it tomorrow. You can also email me lol. Anyways hope this helps.

Hey Logan,
 
I just added your prototypes to mine. It worked out fine. I just wanted to know if you could give me a brief explanation of the prototypes. To make sure I understand them and can include notes to expain them. I will be working on it in the morning I am hoping to have it posted early in the day.

Tonya,

Yeah I will try to give you a brief rundown of what each screen is doing.

The query builder screen is where the administrator can build a report to retrieve data from the database. They use the listboxes on the left to decide what they want to select from the database. Then they are able to filter the results on the right, as they enable the bottom row of fields an additional field will be added but not enabled. This allows the user to add multiple filter levels. They can then run the query or name it and save it to the query library for later use.

Advanced query builder is where the administrator, if they know SQL well enough can create their own query. They can then run it on the spot or they can name it and add it to the query library for later use.

The query library is a collection of previously created sql queries that can be selected and ran by clicking run query. They can also delete the query by selecting it and pressing the delete query button. If a user wants to make changes they can click on the query, press show code the code will appear in the bottom box, and they can then click copy code and paste it into the custom query space to make changes. 

The user tab is where the administrator can see the current users of the system, they can then select a user and it will populate the fields on the right with that users information. They are able to make changes. Or they can create a new user by typing the information in the fields and then pressing add new user.

I hope this helps, if not then please just let me know.

Thanks,
Logan

hey i added some stuff to the api, at the bottom, would you mind looking at it when you get a chance.

I have been playing with java and the db, I am able to connect to the db, retrieve data from it, and insert data into the db, so I am pretty pumped I got all that figured out.

I think it would be a good idea to set 2 week goals for each person on this project. Please send me an email today letting me know what you plan to have done by a week from Monday (March 9). If you are not sure how best to split up your portion of the project let Dr. Garrett know and he can meet with you.

The hard part is over as far as I can see, let's write some code and put out a great looking product!

Tony

p.s. look at the new API I shared with everyone, it has some small but important changes and will be updated as we go along in case we missed anything.

I just spoke with Dr. Garrett a few minutes ago. Most of what was said was just for me and Logan to know. But he did ask me to pass along a message to y'all: he would like to be updated whenever we have something to show, and when we have something that works. So, whenever we make some progress, it probably would not be a bad idea to shoot him off an email.

I spoke to Dr. Garrett today, and he said he'd like to have a group meeting real soon, just so he can know where everything stands, see if there's any problems, etc. He did not tell me anything as far as a date or time, though; he said he'd probably send Jaleesa and Tony an email, so they will probably know more fairly soon. Just thought it might be nice to give everyone a little heads-up.

Tony,

It's going pretty good, a couple of questions.

1.) If administrator A, is logged in and saves some queries, then you have Administrator B, login and create some queries. Ok so now we have to admins that have access to the admin panel and can view the queries created. Can they view each other's created queries? If not and they are only able to view their own, I need a way to get their username so I know who the user is. This may be something we don't want to worry about this late in the game, and just let all Administrators view all of the queries created. I am going to program it like that for now. If you have any questions or comments let me know, we can discuss it tomorrow if need be.

2.) I sent Dr. Garrett an email about this but I haven't heard back from him yet. I probably will hear back from him later, but maybe you have ran across this before. If I need to programmatically  create many instances of a JComboBox, or a text field or any other form component. How would you do it, I'm trying to figure it out for the query builder form, when the user hits the checkbox it should continue to add Combo Boxes, I will figure something out but thought maybe you could give me some direction.

Thanks,
Logan

1) yeah, I'd do it the easy way, allow all admins to see all saved queries.

2) for each check box you need to see if it is checked, if so, then create the corresponding combo box... right? is that what you mean?

Yes, real time, I have already got some realtime stuff going on. Like if you select age then it shows a textbox where you can input the age, but if you select race then a drop down menu shows with the possible races. I guess I am just curious as to how each control will be named?

Hey. I missed the meeting on Monday, due to a severe headache. One of those romm-spinning type of things. I looked at the Meeting Week 5 thing on Blackboard. One of the goals said we're going to begin implementing the database. Email me back and let me know if you've started already, what you've got so far if you have, and anything you need me to do. We just started looking at implementation stuff in my Databases class, so I think it lines up quite nicely timeline-wise.

Maybe I jumped the gun a little on asking to meet with you face-to-face. I was dummying up data for you, and I looked in the Analysis Document for a quick reference. I noticed there were a lot of fields listed under the Enhanced Database Support that are not in the schema. Some of the key ones are these: 
Reaction_time -- The amount of time a participant takes to make a decision
Answer_choices -- Possible answers for the selected question
Indifference_point -- The point at which a participant will no longer choose to wait for a greater reward
Escape_condition -- Whether or not the participant escaped from the experiment
Escape_point -- The point at which the participant escaped from the experiment
Num_words -- The number of words read by the participant during a certain amount of time
Num_stops -- The number of times the participant stopped reading for more than x seconds

I was running on almost no sleep when I noticed this, so I probably made a bigger deal of it than it probably was. Plus the fact that the tables have been set up... Anyway. This is about all I wanted to discuss. Enjoy.

Okay, here's that set of operations that can be performed on the various fields. I got the basics covered, but I'm sure there's more operations that SQL can perform we haven't yet covered in my database class. But since I'm sure you're asking for this for the query builder form, I feel pretty sure the person who needs said form won't really need to know all the super advanced stuff, right?

We need to make some major changes to the database. I don't think it will change a great deal of your existing code, but the schema that we had won't work. I know because it's basically the same one that I used, and now I see the problems with it. Can we meet and fix the problem? Are you free tomorrow (Thursday)?

Ok, I've been working on the RealTimeUI. What is going to happen is there are a few new variables that you will need to pull from the XML.

1) a string of a text file that contains the information for the partcipant to read. ie. "C:\readthis.txt"
2) a list of what they want displayed on the tick marks. ie, tick1, tick2, tick3. If we can do this as an array it would be much easier, let me know if you can form it and pass it as an int array of size 10.
3) a boolean that indicates whether the slide ruler will be shown. 

Logan, all of these things have to be added to the database also. I know this is short short notice, but that is what I've come across so far.

Dr. Garrett,

In the method table fields lori and tony are returning different data types than what you had specified in the schema, do I need to have them change these or just change it in the database. 

You had later_time_units specified as an integer however I had to make it a varchar(256) for it to work, they have it returning as "SECONDS"
You also had type as an integer but I once again changed it to a varchar(256) for it to work, they have it returning as "MULTIPLE_CHOICE"
You had response_delay as a decimal but I changed it to varchar(256), they have response_delay returning as "1.0 SECONDS"

Please advise on how we need to fix this.


Thanks,
Logan

It needs to stay as I've listed it. If you can open up the Visio document, you should see some notes about each of those datatypes. You'll have to do a mapping from what Tony and Lori give you to the type that you put into the database, though. For instance, Tony and Lori may give you later_time_units as a thing of type Time, where Time can have the values of SECONDS, MINUTES, etc. You'll notice that the Visio document says something like SECONDS=1, MINUTES=2, etc. So you'll add a 1 to the database as opposed to the string "SECONDS". (There is absolutely no reason to add a string in this case. When you're further along, you'll look back and see why.)

So look in the Visio document to find the mappings for those things. I think that the response_delay was noted to just be stored as seconds no matter what. So if they give it to you in minutes or hours, just do the conversion to seconds first, and then add that to the database.

Make sense?

Ok, I realize this is probably a fairly "stupid" question however at this point I am just trying to get this all finished up and have thrown pride out the window. Anyways in the database, there are some fields that are required. Should these be set to NULL? I am a little confused as to how NULL in the database works. If something is NULL does it make that field required? also if a field is set to "none" then can I leave it blank. I am in the MULTIPLE CHOICE method and there are some fields that are not used such as progress_ruler_enabled and I would like to leave it blank but it is a bool so it won't let me.

please advise

You should be able to set the non-required fields to be allowed to be null, and you should be able to make them have null as the default value. The required fields should be set to not be null (since they're required and must be given data upon record creation). So then when you insert a record, you MUST insert all of the required fields and you MAY insert non-required stuff. The other non-required stuff will be initialized as null in the database.

Make sense? And, yes, you should forget about pride. It's overrated anyway.

If response delay is supposed to always be in seconds why is it a
decimal and not just an int?

Thanks,

I think you will agree that 1.234 seconds is a meaningful value. So the datatype should be decimal. It's very reasonable for them to say "I want a response delay of one and a half seconds."

Agreed, while you're on a roll, Lori doesn't seem to know what the sooner_time_value & sooner_time_units are can you please elaborate on this for me so I can let her know.

Also, is it ok if I insert all of the data for every method, such as escape_enabled when the Multiple Choice method has been used? I know that some data is optional and not required so I am just wanting to verify that it is ok if I insert all of the data for every method even if that method doesn't use that. I have NULL enabled and set as my default value for the optional fields however the tinybit(1) or bool values, and decimal fields require that some type of input be inserted so I have been inserting a 0 and it appears to go in as NULL, is this acceptable? If not how can I fix it?

Thanks Again,
Logan
